# Fantasy Baseball Prediction Model: Project Overview
- Created a ML model to predict MLB playersâ€™ offensive fantasy value for the next season given their past statistics to help in future fantasy baseball drafts.
- Compared output of model to historical ADP rankings to see if the model gave me an edge over ADP.
- Downloaded 9 years of historical data (2010-2018) from FanGraphs (link in Data Sources section below)
- Manipulated the raw data to create a "Fantasy Value"
- Optimized Linear, Elastic Net, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and SVM models using GridSearchCV (LightGBM used BayesianOptimization) to reach the best model

## Code and Resources Use
**Python Version:** 3.7\
